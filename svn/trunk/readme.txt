Embed the Feedback Fish widget into your WordPress site to collect user feedback.

== Description ==

The [Feedback Fish](https://feedback.fish) widget allows you to collect feedback directly for your website. Any feedback submissions will be sent to Feedback Fish where you can manage them in a neat dashboard, as well as your email.

Installing this plugin will add a "Send feedback" button to your primary navigation that opens the widget.
